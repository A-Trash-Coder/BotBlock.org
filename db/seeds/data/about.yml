  title: A central bot stats API
  content: "{{site_name}} provides a simple to use [central API for
    developers](/api/docs) to post their bot's server/guild count to all bot
    lists that we have listed who support bot statistics on their site. This
    makes life easier for a bot developer as they don't have to worry about
    getting the API details for each list and then posting to every single list
    from within their bot. We handle the hard work, the bot developer just needs
    to post their stats to us."

    The {{site_name}} site was created and originally developed by [Matt
    Cowley](http://mattcowley.co.uk/?utm_source={{site_name}}). It is now
    maintained by a team of users on the [{{site_name}} Discord
    server](/discord). Recently, the full service (website & API) was rewritten
    by the amazing
    [Jacob_DH#1234](https://github.com/DetectiveHuman/?utm_source={{site_name}})
    (in Node.js, stability increased greatly).


    The icon used for {{site_name}} was created by Jet.

  content: "{{site_name}} is a home of [all bot lists for Discord bots](/lists) as well
    as the centralised [server/guild count posting API](/api/docs#count) and our
    other [API endpoints](/api/docs). The aim of the site and project is to
    provide a central place for bot developers and also normal Discord users to
    discover all the possible sites where Discord bots are listed to give
    everyone the best chance of finding or promoting what they want."

  title: An open and neutral project
  content: >-
    {{site_name}} has the aim of being an open and neutral project. As such, we
    welcome anyone to [suggest corrections](/contact) for details about anything
    on the site or to [propose a new addition](/contact) to be added to the
    site. Further, we make clear what we do with any data posted to us in [our
    API documentation](/api/docs) so that everyone understands how we operate.
    We work closely with owners of these lists to ensure that their list details
    and API information are up to date.


    As part of our neutral position, we will investigate any reports of issues with lists on the {{site_name}} site and may briefly hide these sites whilst those investigations are carried out (API posting, if supported by the list, will not be stopped during this time). As an example, we expect lists to be compliant with the law and any licenses relating to their site. If a list is found to violate a license, such as if it is a clone without the correct license, we may hide this list until this is resolved. You can view all currently hidden lists on the [hidden lists nofollow](/lists/hidden) page.


    {{site_name}} also keeps a record of all Discord bot lists that have shutdown. These are given the defunct flag and are hidden throughout the site alongside being excluded from all {{site_name}} API endpoints. These lists can be viewed on the dedicated [defunct lists nofollow](/lists/defunct) page.

  title: List Spotlight
  content: On the front page of {{site_name}} is the list spotlight. This section
    randomly selects two lists from the site at random on load to be displayed
    to the user in the spotlight. These lists have no affiliation with the site
    and are not paying to be there, they are randomly picked by the site to be
    shown at the time the page is requested by the user visiting the site.
